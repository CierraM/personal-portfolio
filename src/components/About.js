                                My name is Cierra Morris. In grade school, I was a math whiz and musician. Now, I am a full stack web developer with a passion for learning and problem solving. I discovered programming in college and fell in love with it because it let me work through mind-bending logic puzzles, while being creative at the same time. I am introverted and observant, detail-oriented and motivated.

                                In my free time, I like reading, patio gardening, and trying new foods! The weirdest thing I have ever eaten is raw whale. My favorite food is freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.
